h1. Classic Early Adopter

I made private membership software for raves and cannabis clubs before I knew what a CRM was.

XLsuite was a Rails hosting platform I built before Shopify was a thing. 
It evolved from my Christmas Light Installation business (my first business in a box). 
We ran sites in many industries, including real estate, e-commerce, content marketing, events and, more recently, cannabis.
